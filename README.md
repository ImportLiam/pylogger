# pylogger
- Keystroke logger and distributer for educational purposes. 
- The intended purpose of the keylogger is to gather keystrokes of another user through access of their email credentials. 
- Gathering the email credentials warrants the use of hard tooling like a packet sniffer or methods like social engineering to have your starting material to run this code.
- To do this in a safer manner, you can spin up a virtual machine and create another email account on the virtual machine (to be edited later)
