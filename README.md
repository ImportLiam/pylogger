# pylogger
- Keystroke logger and distributer for educational purposes. 
- The intended purpose of the keylogger is to gather keystrokes of another user via their email credentials.
- Additionally there is a screen capturing tool that is currently being debugged and streamlined.
- Gathering the email credentials without consent is not a good idea.
- This is only to demontrate troubleshooting buggy python code and producing a reasonable tool for demonstration purposes
- Looking forward, there will likely be a GUI interface with a basic pop up window accompanying the live video screen capture.
